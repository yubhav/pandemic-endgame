## Pandemic Endgame

### What it does

It is a web application where you can choose your favorite avenger character and help the world in this pandemic using your jumping skills. You can also trigger the jump function using your hand/palm by opening it.

### How it works

- You can start by choosing any character i.e. the avenger of your choice.
- By clicking Start Game you can see your character and the game canvas.
- The character can jump (press space or up arrow) to avoid the virus that comes towards him/her.
- You can also open up your hand/palm to trigger the jump function.
- Every virus successfully avoided will add a point to our score.
- Every 6 points in our score will make the game level up.
- After the game is over we can click on Play Again and start over.
